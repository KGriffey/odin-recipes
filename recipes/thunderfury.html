        <h3>DID SOMEONE SAY: "THUNDERFURY, BLESSED BLADE OF THE WINDSEEKER?"</h3>
        <p>
            Once wielded by Thunderaan, Prince of Air, this is a weapon of boundless elemental fury and would prove to be a formidable force 
            on the battlefield. Do you have what it takes to brave the most treacherous depths of Blackrock Mountain, confront its prior owner, 
            and claim this lost power for yourself?
